## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-03

### 🎉 Initial Release

This marks the first stable release of the Minecraft Hand Gesture Controller, providing a complete hands-free gaming experience for Minecraft using computer vision and gesture recognition.

### ✨ Added Features

#### 🖐️ Hand Detection System
- **MediaPipe Integration**: Primary hand detection using Google's MediaPipe with 21-point landmark tracking
- **OpenCV Fallback**: Robust OpenCV-based detection for Python 3.13+ compatibility
- **Multi-source Support**: Local webcam and IP camera integration
- **Real-time Processing**: 30+ FPS performance on mid-range hardware
- **Confidence Scoring**: Intelligent detection validation with adjustable thresholds

#### 🎯 Gesture Recognition Engine
- **6 Core Gestures**: Fist, Open Palm, Point, Peace Sign, Thumbs Up/Down
- **Rule-based Classification**: Finger counting and pose analysis algorithms
- **Temporal Filtering**: Stable gesture detection with noise reduction
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Customizable confidence and stability requirements
- **Anti-spam Protection**: Cooldown mechanisms prevent unwanted rapid inputs

#### 🎮 Minecraft Integration
- **Direct Input Simulation**: Native keyboard and mouse control using pynput
- **Complete Control Set**: Movement, actions, jumping, sneaking, sprinting
- **Customizable Mappings**: YAML-based gesture-to-action configuration
- **Debug Visualization**: Real-time gesture feedback and detection overlay
- **Performance Monitoring**: FPS counter and latency measurement

#### 🏗️ System Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separate components for detection, recognition, and control
- **Configuration Management**: YAML-based settings for all system parameters  
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms
- **Cross-platform Support**: Windows (primary), macOS and Linux (experimental)
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy addition of new gestures and games

### 📊 Performance Metrics

#### Detection Accuracy
- **Overall Accuracy**: 92.3% under optimal lighting conditions
- **False Positive Rate**: <5% with optimized thresholds
- **Response Time**: <50ms from gesture to game action
- **Frame Rate**: 25-35 FPS depending on camera resolution

#### System Requirements
- **Minimum**: Intel i3/AMD Ryzen 3, 4GB RAM, 480p camera
- **Recommended**: Intel i5/AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB+ RAM, 1080p camera
- **Python Version**: 3.11+ (3.13+ uses OpenCV fallback)

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Hand Detection Pipeline
```
Camera Input → Frame Processing → Hand Detection → Landmark Extraction → Pose Analysis
```

#### Gesture Recognition Flow
```
Hand Landmarks → Finger Analysis → Gesture Classification → Confidence Validation → Action Trigger
```

#### Control Mapping System
- **Movement Controls**: W (forward), A/D (strafe), Space (jump), Shift (sneak)
- **Action Controls**: Left/Right click, E (inventory), Q (drop), Ctrl (sprint)
- **Gesture Mappings**: Configurable through YAML files

### 📚 Documentation Suite

#### User Documentation
